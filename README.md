## 1. Git
Use and understand **Git**! Apply the basic commands, and experiment with time traveling, branches, and merges.  

## 2. UML
Create at least **three UML diagrams**:
- **Use-Case Diagram**
- **Component Diagram**
- **Class Diagram**
- **Activity Diagram**

Export the diagrams as images so they can be viewed without installing additional tools.

## 3. Requirements
### I.Technical Part:
- A functioning mobile device is required.
- The device must be compatible with the app.
- The device must have a working touch screen.

### II.Play the Game:
- The user **MUST** be able to select a square on the Sudoku board.
- The user **MUST** be able to input a number into the selected square by pressing one of the number buttons.
- The user **MUST** be able to erase an already inputted number from the selected square.

### III.Mobile App Development Using Flutter:
- The app **MUST** be developed using Flutter and built to run on Android devices.
- Implement Flutter widgets and best practices for a smooth and responsive UI.

## 4. Analysis
Include a detailed analysis of the project requirements and challenges.

## 5. Event-Storming
Conduct **Event-Storming** as part of Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
- **(A)** Identify your domains. If the domain is too small, invent others around it.
- **(B)** Develop a strategic design with mappings/relationships between domains.
- **(C)** Visualize the mappings in a Core Domain Chart.

## 6. Metrics
Use at least two meaningful metrics, such as:
- **SonarQube** for code analysis and quality assurance.
- Other non-trivial metrics for in-depth project evaluation.

## 7. Clean Code Development
Document and demonstrate **Clean Code Development**:
1. List at least five points showcasing clean code practices and their benefits.
2. Provide a personal **CCD Cheat Sheet** with at least ten points (e.g., as a PDF).

## 8. Build
Use a build management tool like **Ant**, **Maven**, or **Gradle** to:
- Manage dependencies.
- Generate documentation.
- Call tests as part of your build process.

## 9. Continuous Delivery
Create a **Continuous Delivery Pipeline** with tools such as:
- **Jenkins**
- **Travis-CI**
- **GitHub Actions**
- **GitLab CI**

The pipeline should include at least two script calls, such as invoking a build tool or running tests.

## 10. Integrate some nice unit tests
Develop and integrate meaningful **unit tests** into your code. Ensure they are included in the build pipeline.

## 11. IDE
Use a modern IDE like **VSCode** or **IntelliJ**. Highlight your favorite shortcuts and features you’ve learned to use efficiently.

## 12. DSL
Create a small **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** demo, even if it doesn’t directly contribute to the project. This can be in another programming language.

## 13. Functional Programming
Demonstrate **functional programming** principles in your project, such as:
- Using only final data structures.
- Writing side-effect-free functions.
- Utilizing higher-order functions.
- Passing functions as parameters or return values.
- Employing closures or anonymous functions.

You may also explore functional programming in other languages like **F#**, **Clojure**, or **Julia**.
